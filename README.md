# Chosen Projects:

### Isaac:

Contract #3 - Melody Generation (Non-Diegetic Audio)

### Tarik:

User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio)

# Progress:

### Isaac:

Added base unity project
created script that plays randomized audio

#### TODO
* Play 4 harmonized notes at the same time, at a random pitch and tempo - change the clap to a harmony, randomize the pitch. Stretch goal randomize the sound used.
* get a note to play at the same randomized tempo once every off beat
* Get a note to play seperate from the tempo a random amount of times between beats.
* Get a note to play more rarely, every couple of bars, then a seperate note playing every third bar
* get a note to play much quicker that matches with the tempo. Make sure these notes are random but still sound good with the chosen pitch. Ensure there's a chance no note will play sometimes.

### Tarik:

Created a project folder.  
Added buttons.  
Added audio when button is clicked.
Audio is now somewhat randomly generated and sounds horrible.

#### TODO
* Make tone sound nicer.
* Fix it so that it works in editor not just in build.
