# Progress:

### Isaac:

Added base unity project.

created script that plays randomized audio.

Play 4 harmonized notes at the same time, at a random pitch and tempo - change the clap to a harmony, randomize the pitch. Stretch goal randomize the sound used.

Get a note to play seperate from the tempo a random amount of times between beats.

Get a note to play more rarely, every couple of bars, then a seperate note playing every third bar.

Get a note to play much quicker that matches with the tempo. Make sure these notes are random but still sound good with the chosen pitch. Ensure there's a chance no note will play sometimes.
