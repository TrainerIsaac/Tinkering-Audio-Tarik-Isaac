# Chosen Projects:

### Isaac:

Contract #3 - Melody Generation (Non-Diegetic Audio)

### Tarik:

Contract #4 - User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio)

# Progress:

### Isaac:

Added base unity project.

created script that plays randomized audio.

Play 4 harmonized notes at the same time, at a random pitch and tempo - change the clap to a harmony, randomize the pitch. Stretch goal randomize the sound used.

Get a note to play seperate from the tempo a random amount of times between beats.

Get a note to play more rarely, every couple of bars, then a seperate note playing every third bar.

Get a note to play much quicker that matches with the tempo. Make sure these notes are random but still sound good with the chosen pitch. Ensure there's a chance no note will play sometimes.

#### TODO 
* get a note to play at the same randomized tempo once every off beat
* Save the output as a wav file

### Tarik:

#### Done
Created a project folder.  
Added buttons.  
Added audio when button is clicked.
Audio is randomly generated within a range.
A sound plays when you hover over a button
Different sounds for success or failure when clicking on a button.
Commented code.

#### TODO


# Licensing:

We chose a GNU General Public License - as out of all the licenses, it protects us the most from other people stealing and profiting off of our code. The MIT and Apache licenses are similar but do not provide the same legal coverage of GNU GPL. A downside of our chosen license is that it is not very flexible - if any part of the code is under the GPL, then the whole thing must be released under a GPL license. As a result, if anyone uses a piece of our work for a legitimate reason, their entire project now legally must be under GPL, making it far less accessible. Thankfully, all of our work benefits from this license, with no other separate licenses for other sections of code being necessary. Accessibility is also not much of a concern, as we are not affected by how many people do or do not use our code.

While MIT is far more open and allows many more to access our code without having to use the same license, it doesn't protect our code from fraud. GNU GPL also very clearly sets into stone what others legally can and can't do with the project, being one of the longest and most detailed licenses available to us, which protects us from ambiguity and people taking their own, possibly dangerous interpretation of what our license does. The other license we were close to choosing was Apache - as it very much opens our project up to others while sharing the quality of being very specific and detailed much like the GNU license. However, it doesn't have the same protection against others using our code for profit, so was not chosen overall.
